# flutter_updater_package

An easy way to implement OTA updates.

## Getting Started

First you need to mark the dependency ([package]: [version]) in the pubspec.yaml.
Then all you need to do is import the package into a dart file and call Updater.checkUpdates ([String currentVersion], [String latestVersionPath], [String updateUrlPath]);

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
